**"WASABI: A Wasserstein-Based Anatomical Metric for Realism in Synthetic Brain MRIs"**

## 📜 Paper Summary

Generative models enhance neuroimaging by enabling data augmentation, quality improvement, and the study of rare conditions. While recent approaches produce visually realistic MRIs, they often lack anatomical fidelity—a crucial aspect for clinical utility.

**WASABI** introduces a novel evaluation metric that measures the anatomical realism of synthetic brain MRIs using:
- **SynthSeg** for brain parcellation and volumetric feature extraction
- **Multivariate Wasserstein distance** to compare distributions of brain region volumes between real and synthetic data

### 🔍 Key Features
- Evaluates anatomical fidelity of synthetic MRIs
- Sensitive to subtle structural discrepancies
- Outperforms traditional visual and image-level metrics

## 📊 Usage

Coming soon — code will be released upon paper acceptance.
